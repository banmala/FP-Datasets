# FP-Datasets
Datasets for FP generation using GAN 
This is a repo to generate datsets for FP generation Using GAN. Here, we are going to use ROBIN well furnished datasets and create previous datasets following which we can reach up to the furnished datasets. Here we are to generate 5 different types of datasets which are:
1. Augmented Datasets with better spacing in all 4 sides of images with same image size of all images and few other datasets with 30 degree rotation of the current sets.
2. Then we create parcel using the augmented datasets.
3. Then using the same augmented datasets, we create footprint of the floor.
4. Then using the same augmented datasets, we create room split plan of the floor using the color representation of rooms.
5. Then using same augmented datasets, we create well furnished dataset of the floor using the color representation of furniture.
